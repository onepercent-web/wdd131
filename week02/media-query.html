      <h2>Alma 11:37</h2>
      <p>37 And I say unto you again that he cannot save them in their sins;
         for I cannot deny his word, and he hath said that no unclean thing 
         can inherit the kingdom of heaven; therefore, how can ye be saved, 
         except ye inherit the kingdom of heaven? Therefore, ye cannot be saved in your sins.</p>

      <h2>Alma 17:2</h2>
      <p>Now these sons of Mosiah were with Alma at the time the angel first appeared unto him;
         therefore Alma did rejoice exceedingly to see his brethren; and what added more to his
          joy, they were still his brethren in the Lord; yea, and they had waxed strong in the 
          knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a sound understanding and they had 
          searched the scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God.</p>
