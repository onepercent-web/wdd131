                    <p>The beginning of effectors dates back to the 1940s and 1950s with the first guitar amps, such as "Tremolo" and "Reverb". The first effector were not standalone devices but were built into guitar amps. Tremolo periodically changed the volume to create a wavering sound, while Reverb added an echo effect to the sound, making it feel like it was being played in a large space. These effectors added acoustic effects to music and gave songs a unique atmosphere.
                        From the 1950s to the 1960s, effectors started to appear as independent devices rather than being part of the guitar amps. Fuzz and Delay appeared and were pedal-type devices that guitarists could operate with their feet. Fuzz strongly distorted the sound, creating a distinctive, muddled tone that provided a powerful sound for rock music. Delay repeatedly played back the sound, creating an echo-like effect. These effectors expanded the possibilities of sound and influenced music production.
                        In the late 1960s, Distortion and Wah appeared. Distortion strongly distorted the guitar sound, creating a powerful tone. Wah, operated with a pedal, changed the frequency of the sound as you pressed down, giving a unique expression to the guitar sound. These effectors brought new expressive capacities to guitarists.
                        In the 1970s, Phaser and Flanger appeared. Flanger created a swirling effect by slightly delaying and overlapping two sounds. Phaser shifted the phase of the sound, producing a floating sensation reminiscent of outer space. These effectors added unique movement and depth to the sound.
                        The 1970s saw significant advancements and diversity in effectors. Various effectors provides music creators to produce new sounds and greatly expanded the scope of musical expression. The evolution of effectors continues to have a significant impact on modern music creators.
                        From the 1990s onwards, with the development of technology, effectors further evolved. Multi-effectors and digital effectors appeared. Multi-effects devices could handle multiple effectors in one device, allowing music creators to switch between various sound effects. It also became possible to save favorite sounds and combine effects to create new sounds, enhancing flexibility in live performances and recordings.
                        Digital effectors used digital technology to modify the sound. By converting sound to a digital signal for processing and then back to an analog signal, they allowed fine-tuning that was difficult with analog effects. Like multi-effectors, digital effectors could also save and reuse custom effects.
                        In the 1990s, with the improvement of computer performance, software-based effectors appeared. Like samplers, which were software-based effects that could freely manipulate and play back recorded sounds. Samplers makes allowed for music creators to use advanced effects and produce high-quality music on computers, at home. This was wonderful evolution for people who create music on computers at this time.

                        <p>Today, software effects on computers have further evolved, becoming more user-friendly. Recently, software effects utilizing AI technology have also appeared. I thought these technologies will make musical expression more convenient.
                        The history of effectors has evolved the range of musical expression along with technological advancements, enhancing the convenience and creativity of music production. There are many types of effectors, and they are still used and loved by many people today, from the early types such as guitar amp effectors to pedal-style effectors. The history of effectors may see new products appeared with future technological advancements. I want to increase my knowledge of effectors and improve my sound until then.</p>
